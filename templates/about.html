    <p><em>“In everything you do, put GOD first and He will direct and crown your efforts with success”</em></p>
    <p>Integrated Montessori Center (IMC) is a non-sectarian, co-educational institution that offers preschool, grade school and high school education with its main building located in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City. IMC was one of the first ten schools in Taguig City granted permission to open classes for Grades 11 and 12 for SY 2016-2017 with the DepEd’s then implementation of the K-12 curriculum.</p>
    <p>IMC was established in 1992 by Mrs. Angeli C. Cadungog in JUSMAG Area Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City. From 1 preschool classroom of 20 students, it is now offering preschool and grade school in IMC Diego Silang in AFPOVAI Village, Fort Bonifacio. In fulfilling its battle cry “Onward to Excellence,” the new IMC Bayani Branch building along Bayani Road now houses the High School Department.</p>

    <p>The integration of the Montessori approach with other teaching approaches, with the inclusion of the Singapore curriculum and relevant learning materials in English, Math and Science enable the IMC student to excel academically. Evidently, its alumni are admitted and have graduated with honors from top universities in the country such as University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University and University of Santo Tomas.</p>

    <p>For more than 30 years, IMC has continuously progressed and remained steadfast in facing the challenges that confront the Philippine educational system. For these and its remarkably closely-knit community, IMC is a wonderful place to learn and come home to.</p>
